## Preschhol

Since about the time I pregnant with our first, I have constantly researched schools. Asking family and friends what and how they decided on their schooling decision for their family. From their answers, I noticed a trend: depends on the child and discern year to year. Sadly, in the area we live, if we don't start our children in the Catholic school for Kindergarten, than our chances of getting in are slim. Never once was I interested in learning more about homeschooling, only public and private.

So, I started researching the for the "best" preschool to send Madilyn to when she was about 22 months old and I was pregnant with our second. For multiple resaons,  I (we) thought sending her to preschool (or really nursery school) was the logical thing to do to help her get a jump start on school, as our society tells us. Jump start a little girl, who self taught herself her letters, numbers, phonics, and how to read. Ha! As soon as I had to pick her up the first day with a screaming newborn in the backseat (that newborn is now two and she still screams in the car), I was wishing preschool was done forever. I was starting to rethinkg learning about homeschooling. 

She loved every second of her time there and I missed her like crazy, despite the morning naps I was able to sneak in two mornings a week.  Needless to say, she stayed home with me the following year dipped our toes the tiniest bit into homeschooling, which really ended up being reading books, storytime at the library, playing, nature walks, and visiting local musuems. All in all we had a blast. 
We had all intentions of sending her to pre-K this year to help get her "ready" for Kindergarten. Again, help our reading 4 year old get "ready" for Kindergarten. She was signed up for pre-K at a local Catholic preschool. I was mentally preparing myself all summer that she would now be away from me three mornings a week and trying to focus on all the one on one time I would get with Genevieve. However, something was still tugging at my heart.

Then, at the end of July, when we were hit with a pretty hefty dental bill ($15,000) and two ER visits ($3500) all within one month. God's a funny one. So we heavily discerned about pulling Madilyn from preschool. Again, for multiple reasons but finances being at the top. We felt God was calling us to keep Madilyn home and homeschool her (never say never), focusng on her fine motor and handwriting skills.

I'm not sure why I feel the need to defend our schooling decisions but I often do. Probably it's because we are going against the norm of society by not sending her to preschool, which isn't even required. I want her to be play as long as she can without the added stress of school. I want her to love school always. I don't want to make her grow up any faster than she needs to. Sure there are days when, as a stay at home mom, I feel like I need a break but those days are few and far between, and there not enough of those days to send for me to want to send her to preschool.

our plan is to still send her to Kindergarten, next year at our local parish. However, we do know there is a chance she won't get a spot or that we will feel called to keep her home, yet another year.  But until then, we are going to play and make the most of our time with her.

**Disclaimer, I am by no means saying preschool is bad or isn't worth it. This is just what works for our family.
