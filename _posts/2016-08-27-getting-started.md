#Hello

I'm just getting underway here, and we'll see how it goes. Since I first purchased this domain (_fussner.us_) I've 
always had a cheap shared hosting account where I could tinker around and put up little pet projects, etc... but due 
to a multitude of reasons, it just doesn't make sense to keep that shared hosting account around anymore. Well that 
shared hosting account is expiring now, so I've switched my domain registrar to [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) 
and am trying out [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I've known about gh-pages for a while now, and have sort of 
tinkered with it a little; but not nearly enough to really give it an attempt worthwhile of calling it an attempt. Well 
here is that attempt... let's see how it goes.
